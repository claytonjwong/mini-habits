## Intro to Mini Habits
* We are quick to blame ourselves for lack of progress but slow to blame our strategies 
    * doing a little bit is *infinitely* bigger and better than doing nothing
    * doing a little bit *every day* has greater impact than doing a lot on one day
* With the right knowledge and strategy to change, convulted and impossible become straightforward and possible

### What is a Mini Habit?
* A mini habit is a VERY small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day
    * A mini habit is basically a *much* smaller version of a new habit you want to perform
    * A small amount of willpower forces us to perform mini habits daily

### What are the benefits of Mini Habits?
* Proper mindset - “too small to fail” practically guarantees daily success
* Positive feedback loop of always attainable target increases self-efficacy
* Reduce internal resistance to change
* Leverage small steps into habits built upon consistency 
* Feel unstoppable rather than unstartable
* Create and strengthen specific neural pathways with repetition 
* Avoid negative feedback loop
   * bad habits -> stress -> more bad habits -> more stress...

## How Your Brain Works
### Conscious and Unconscious Entities
* 2 keys to habit change: Repetition and Reward
    * Repetition is the language of the unconscious brain (ie. repeat it to remember it)
        * The subconscious brain loves efficiency and learns to automate frequent tasks
    * The brain will resist change unless those changes reward the brain
    * The goal in creating habits is to change the brain with repetition
* The brain changes slowly over time
    * This is a good thing, otherwise we could wake up a different person each day
    * This can be frustrating when attempting to learn
* The only way to create habits is to teach the rest of the brain to like what the prefrontal cortex wants.

### A Stupid Repeater & A Smart Manager
* The basal ganglia
    * understands “what is”
    * recognizes and efficiently repeats patterns until told otherwise
    * *not* conscious or aware of higher-level goals
    * plays a central role in habit formation and procedural learning
    * lots of stamina (ex: long-distance marathon runner)
* The prefrontal cortex
    * focuses on “what could be”
    * understands long-term benefits and consequences
    * concious of higher-level goals (a trait unique to humans)
    * has the ability to override the basal ganglia
    * short-term thinking and decision making
    * the conscious part of the brain identified as “you”
    * minimal stamina (ex: sprinter)

## Willpower vs. Motivation
Motivation is an unreliable strategy for lasting change.  "Getting motivated" dominates self-help literature despite being completely ineffective long term.  If getting motivated if your strategy, you can't build habits, since habits require consistent repetition.  Motivation is unreliable and inconsistent because it's based on how you feel, and we've known for centuries that human feelings are fluid and unpredictable.  Anything dependent on human emotion is completely unreliable.  Motivation is like building a house on liquid.  Motivation is *not* easy to cultivate on demand since it's hard to change your feelings by thinking.  Often we don't want to get motivated, so if you don't want to get motivated, and getting motivated was your strategy for doing things, then you've lost the battle before it has begun.  A destructive habit to have is believing that you have to be motivated to act; this idea that motivation preceeds action can become deeply ingrained into a person's psyche.  As a behavior begins its transition into habit, you will become less emotional about it.  The act of performing a habit is curiously emotionless.  Lack of enthusiasm after some time is counterintuitively a positive sign that control is moving to the more stable and automated basal ganglia.

While willpower is the best strategy, most people don't know how to use it and drain their willpower reserves quickly.  By using willpower, motivation becaues more reliable; motivation comes fast when you take action first.  Willpower is extremely reliable and can be strengthened like a muscle.  Thus, we can strengthen our ability to improve ourselves.  Using willpower, you can schedule an activity and do it whether you are motivated at the time or not.  We've got to maximize our self-control reserves to be effective at changing ourselves.  Ego depletion essentially means the same thing as willpower or self-control depletion.

### The 5 biggest factors found to cause ego depletion:

1. Effort
2. Perceived Difficulty
3. Negative Affect
4. Subjective Fatigue
5. Blood Glucose Levels
