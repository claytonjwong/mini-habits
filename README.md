## Intro to Mini Habits
* We are quick to blame ourselves for lack of progress but slow to blame our strategies 
    * doing a little bit is *infinitely* bigger and better than doing nothing
    * doing a little bit *every day* has greater impact than doing a lot on one day
* With the right knowledge and strategy to change, convulted and impossible become straightforward and possible

### What is a Mini Habit?
* A mini habit is a VERY small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day
    * A mini habit is basically a *much* smaller version of a new habit you want to perform
    * A small amount of willpower forces us to perform mini habits daily

### What are the benefits of Mini Habits?
* Proper mindset - “too small to fail” practically guarantees daily success
* Positive feedback loop of always attainable target increases self-efficacy
* Reduce internal resistance to change
* Leverage small steps into habits built upon consistency 
* Feel unstoppable rather than unstartable
* Create and strengthen specific neural pathways with repetition 
* Avoid negative feedback loop
   * bad habits -> stress -> more bad habits -> more stress...

## How Your Brain Works
### Conscious and Unconscious Entities
* 2 keys to habit change: Repetition and Reward
    * Repetition is the language of the unconscious brain (ie. repeat it to remember it)
        * The subconscious brain loves efficiency and learns to automate frequent tasks
    * The brain will resist change unless those changes reward the brain
    * The goal in creating habits is to change the brain with repetition
* The brain changes slowly over time
    * This is a good thing, otherwise we could wake up a different person each day
    * This can be frustrating when attempting to learn
* The only way to create habits is to teach the rest of the brain to like what the prefrontal cortex wants.

### A Stupid Repeater & A Smart Manager
* The basal ganglia
    * understands “what is”
    * recognizes and efficiently repeats patterns until told otherwise
    * *not* conscious or aware of higher-level goals
    * plays a central role in habit formation and procedural learning
    * lots of stamina (ex: long-distance marathon runner)
* The prefrontal cortex
    * focuses on “what could be”
    * understands long-term benefits and consequences
    * concious of higher-level goals (a trait unique to humans)
    * has the ability to override the basal ganglia
    * short-term thinking and decision making
    * the conscious part of the brain identified as “you”
    * minimal stamina (ex: sprinter)

## Willpower vs. Motivation
Motivation is an unreliable strategy for lasting change.  "Getting motivated" dominates self-help literature despite being completely ineffective long term.  If getting motivated if your strategy, you can't build habits, since habits require consistent repetition.  Motivation is unreliable and inconsistent because it's based on how you feel, and we've known for centuries that human feelings are fluid and unpredictable.  Anything dependent on human emotion is completely unreliable.  Motivation is like building a house on liquid.  Motivation is *not* easy to cultivate on demand since it's hard to change your feelings by thinking.  Often we don't want to get motivated, so if you don't want to get motivated, and getting motivated was your strategy for doing things, then you've lost the battle before it has begun.  A destructive habit to have is believing that you have to be motivated to act; this idea that motivation preceeds action can become deeply ingrained into a person's psyche.  As a behavior begins its transition into habit, you will become less emotional about it.  The act of performing a habit is curiously emotionless.  Lack of enthusiasm after some time is counterintuitively a positive sign that control is moving to the more stable and automated basal ganglia.

While willpower is the best strategy, most people don't know how to use it and drain their willpower reserves quickly.  By using willpower, motivation becaues more reliable; motivation comes fast when you take action first.  Willpower is extremely reliable and can be strengthened like a muscle.  Thus, we can strengthen our ability to improve ourselves.  Using willpower, you can schedule an activity and do it whether you are motivated at the time or not.  We've got to maximize our self-control reserves to be effective at changing ourselves.  Ego depletion essentially means the same thing as willpower or self-control depletion.

### The 5 biggest factors found to cause ego depletion:

1. Effort
2. Perceived Difficulty
3. Negative Affect
4. Subjective Fatigue
5. Blood Glucose Levels

Smart willpower management is key to personal development as smart money management is key to financial success.  If you don't plan your action strategy out, you'll flip-flop between poor willpower and motivation strategies, and end up frustrated.

## Strategy of Mini Habits
Take 1 to 4 "stupid small" strategic actions every day.  These actions are too small to fail, and too small to skip for special occasions.  They serve dual purposes:
1. To spark you to do more
2. To become (mini) habits

"one small step" + "desired behavior" = "high probability of further steps"

People who feel like winners act like winners.  Nothing is more motivating and inspiring than seeing yourself take action.

When it comes to activites that require physical or mental effort, it's extremely common to overestimate how difficult they are.  By starting small and entiering reality of doing the work, your mind will see that one small step is not as difficult as it first seemed, and that taking the next step isn't difficult either.  You will eventually form a comfortable habit of taking that first step into a new behavior.

The common way people go about this change is diving in and trying a "whatever it takes to succeed" strategy.  This is like sprinting well outside of your comfort circle and fighting to stay there.  That's when your subconcious brain says, "this is interesting, but I'm really uncomfortable with this huge change," and it forces you back inside your comfort circle when your motivation and willpower can no longer support you out there.  Your brain is like a cat in the snow; spring massive changes on it and it will run back to its comfortable routines.  But introduce changes gently and in small doses, and it just might be curious (not scared) to explore them more.  Your brain is programmed to resist change, but most of that resistance comes at two particular moments:
1. Resistance before action: starting is the hardest part, but that doesn't mean it has to be hard to start.  "Hardest" is relative.  When the first action is just a nudge, initial resistance shrinks.
2. Resistance to do more: if you're ever in a situation where you'd like to do more than your minimum requirement, simply continue to use small steps (if necessary).  But do not come to expect this every time.  Your requirement is small for all the reasons we're discussing!  You don't want to jeopardize your long-term success for short-term gain.


## The Mini Habits Difference

The brain resists big changes.  The prefrontal cortex has a spending allowance before the automatic part takes over.  For every task, the subconcious brain looks at what you're asking of it and charges you willpower to get into the control room.  You're only allowed to ask for so much manual control per day.  Mini habits are low-willpower Trojan horses that can leverage their easy access into the brain's control room into big results.  The perfect team in personal development is small steps and willpower.  As long as you have enough willpower for an action, you can take that action.  Small steps require little to no willpower.  So it's like having unlimited willpower.  You can get yourself to do just about anything if you guide yourself along in super small steps.  Try it.  Many times when you're tired, engaging your mind or body will take you up.

Mini habits don't have a specific end date, because we don't know how long it will take to form the habit.  Instead, we'll look for signs that the behavior is a habit.

Mini habits increase your self-efficacy.  Self-efficacy is your belief in your ability to influence an outcome.  Lacking the baseline self-efficacy required for success, however, is extremely common in people who suffer from depression, weak willpower, and repeated failures.  If you expect to fail, positive results are hard to come by.  Mini habits are a self-efficacy-generating machine, and importantly, you can get started successfully with zero self-efficacy.  Mini habits double as training for believing in yourself.  Your brain latches on to any repetition you throw at it.  So a problem many people develop is an expectation of failing to reach their goals.  Over time, this crushes their self-efficacy because it's hard to believe the next time will be difference (especially if you're using the same strategy that failed last time).  Mini habits are the perfect way to start over.  No longer will you be intimidated by massive goals.  No longer will you be attacked with feelings of guilt and inadequacy for falling short.  No, this time you're going to be succeeding on a daily basis.  The victories may be small, but one small victory to a defeated mind is a big victory.  The downfall of many self-help books is that they'll say you have to sweat blood to get what you want in life.  Well, isn't sweating blood a sign that a part of you really doesn't like it?  Wouldn't you rather treat yourself well in the process of changing into a better person?

A habit is the strongest behavioral foundation a human can have.  Habits can be built stronger and higher.

### Mini Habits Destroy Fear, Doubt, Intimidation, and Hesitation

These things are best conquered by action.  Taking the first step kills fear over time, if not immediately.  Fear can't exist if you've experienced something and it wasn't scary.  Mini habits are perfectly suited for any mood or situation.  You can be happy and motivated, tired and depressed, or even sick, and still complete your mini habits and possibly more.  Mini habits expose you to your doubts and fears in a way that feels safe and empowering.  Whatever you've been wanting to do will become possible.

### Insane Bonus Effects of Increased Mindfullness and Willpower

One of the most important skills a person can develop is mindfullness, which is being aware of what you think and do.  Being mindful is the difference between living purposefully and going through the motions.  You will simultaneously and naturally develop a mindfullness habit, which will help with all future habit modification (including bad habits).  Frequent repetition of small tasks is the ideal way to "exercise" the willpower muscle.  The stronger your willpower, the greater mastery you'll have over your body.  Many people are slaves to their bodies, responding to every feeling and whim.  They believe they can't do things if they don't want to do them at the time.
