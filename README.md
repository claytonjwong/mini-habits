# Mini Habits
Permanently add healthy, habitual behaviors to your life

## Intro to Mini Habits
* We are quick to blame ourselves for lack of progress but slow to blame our strategies 
    * doing a little bit is *infinitely* bigger and better than doing nothing
    * doing a little bit *every day* has greater impact than doing a lot on one day
* With the right knowledge and strategy to change, convulted and impossible become straightforward and possible

### What is a Mini Habit?
* A mini habit is a VERY small positive behavior that you force yourself to do every day
    * A mini habit is basically a *much* smaller version of a new habit you want to perform
    * A small amount of willpower forces us to perform mini habits daily

### What are the benefits of Mini Habits?
* Proper mindset - “too small to fail” practically guarantees daily success
* Positive feedback loop of always attainable target increases self-efficacy
* Reduce internal resistance to change
* Leverage small steps into habits built upon consistency 
* Feel unstoppable rather than unstartable
* Create and strengthen specific neural pathways with repetition 
* Avoid negative feedback loop
   * bad habits -> stress -> more bad habits -> more stress...

## How Your Brain Works
### Conscious and Unconscious Entities
* 2 keys to habit change: Repetition and Reward
    * Repetition is the language of the unconscious brain (ie. repeat it to remember it)
        * The subconscious brain loves efficiency and learns to automate frequent tasks
    * The brain will resist change unless those changes reward the brain
    * The goal in creating habits is to change the brain with repetition
* The brain changes slowly over time
    * This is a good thing, otherwise we could wake up a different person each day
    * This can be frustrating when attempting to learn
* The only way to create habits is to teach the rest of the brain to like what the prefrontal cortex wants.

### A Stupid Repeater & A Smart Manager
* The basal ganglia
    * understands “what is”
    * recognizes and efficiently repeats patterns until told otherwise
    * *not* conscious or aware of higher level goals
    * plays a central role in habit formation and procedural learning
    * lots of stamina (ex: long-distance marathon runner)
* The prefrontal cortex
    * understands long-term benefits and consequences
    * has the ability to override the basal ganglia
    * short-term thinking and decision making
    * focuses on “what could be”
    * the conscious part of the brain identified as “you”
    * minimal stamina (ex: sprinter)
